Client / Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing code that's maintainable, readable, and adaptable is crucial for success in development. Not only so that code can easily be applied across multiple areas, but so that debugging and updating code doesn't pose a challenge. If the code I'm writing gets too complicated and messy, it's much more difficult to pick up the next day. The best ways to write good code is through modularization, good parameter and variable naming, consistency in style, error handling, and clear commenting. The CRUD python module demonstrates these very well. Each of the elements of CRUD are distinct from each other, but consistent in their style and naming. They all have basic error handling and clear comments that tell the user exactly what the intention of the code is. This makes it very adaptable to other uses in database programs. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching problems as a developer requires a very methodological way of thinking. Before starting to write code, understanding the requirements is absolutely necessary. I will often write out basic psuedocode that would be needed to implement the requirements that I'm seeing. It's also important to have a very clear understanding of the tools and languages that are going to be used to develop a project. If something isn't clear to me from a textbook, I'll often search other sources for more information, or even go straight to the documentation. This was especially useful in project 2 when I was trying to understand the syntax for Dash and Plotly.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

At their core, computer scientists simplify complexity and make existing processes more efficient. A computer is a tool that can speed up real world solutions to problems. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, combing through a database for dogs that fit a particular need could take hours. The dashboard made the information available within seconds, as well as clear visualization for easier use.
